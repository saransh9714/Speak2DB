# Speak2DB
Speak2DB converts natural language queries into SQL statements using NLP and intent parsing. It takes spoken or typed user input, processes it with language models and templates, and generates executable SQL to interact with a database. The tool simplifies querying for non-technical users by bridging conversational language and structured queries.
